State of affairs
----------------

Requesting a vhost that is a domain name.

1. request is made
2. request is seen by a staff member
3. requester is private messaged asking for proof of domain ownership
4. staff member checks:
  - file on the site at the server pointed to by the domain name
  - DNS TXT record
  - email to staff
5. if all is well, the vhost will be activated.

Better flow
-----------

1. user makes request
2. user gets a link to a website to confirm the request
3. user follows directions and then gets the vhost activated by a bot

TODO
----

- [X] make a base web template
- [X] serve it somehow
- [ ] add Atheme API access
- [ ] check vhost stuff somehow
