Code of Conduct
===============

Your code and ideas behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in 
critique and criticism. The review will almost always require improvements to 
the code before it can be included in Admiral. Know that this happens because 
everyone involved wants to see the best possible solution for the overall 
success of Admiral.

If however, anyone feels personally abused, threatened, or otherwise 
uncomfortable due to this process, that is not acceptable.  If so, please 
contact [Christine Dodrill](mailto:me@christine.website) with details.

As a reviewer of code, please strive to keep things civil and focused on the 
technical issues involved. We are all humans, and frustrations can be high on 
both sides of the process. Try to keep in mind the immortal words of Bill and 
Ted, "Be excellent to each other."
