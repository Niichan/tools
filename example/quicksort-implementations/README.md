quicksort-implementations
=========================

Trying to implement quicksort in a few languages.

Please submit other languages as pull requests. Extra credit for obfuscated 
versions as well as easy to read ones.

## QuickSort

An empty list cannot be sorted.

A quicksorted list has a pivot. This is the value that is sorted against. 
A quicksorted list is really 3 lists together:

1. The quicksorted list elements that are less than the pivot
2. The pivot
3. The quicksorted list elements that are greater than the pivot

This repository will implement that algorithm in several computer programming 
languages.
