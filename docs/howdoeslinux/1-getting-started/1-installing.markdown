# Installing Linux for This Course

## Needed materials

There are three ways you can go about setting up a machine to use for this 
course:

1. A virtual machine (recommended)
2. Dual-booting your computer
3. Renting a virtual private server

We suggest using a virtual machine as it is the cheapest and is easiest to set 
up. If you are already a linux user, we highly suggest you set up a VM for this 
class in case you accidentally break something.

## Virtual Machine

There are several choices for installing a virtual machine hypervisor on 
a computer, but the quickest option is going to be Oracle's Virtualbox.

### Virtualbox

Download Virtualbox from http://virtualbox.org. Install it for your operating 
system.

The OS we are going to use for this course is Debian 7. You are free to try and 
use another flavor of linux for this course, but if you do you might find 
yourself without any support for oddities or unexpected system upgrades.

<!-- TODO: add information on installing Debian here, plug #!? -->

Lab: install debian. Prove you installed it.
