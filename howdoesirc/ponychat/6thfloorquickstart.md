In most clients, set the server to irc.ponychat.net

Autojoin channel #6thfloor

Chatzilla works if you use firefox as a browser. CIRC for chrome is also cool.

Irssi: /server irc.ponychat.net 6667

I personally use weechat on my tower and xchat when mobile on my netbook.

Let me know if you want to use my bouncer for persistent irc connections.
