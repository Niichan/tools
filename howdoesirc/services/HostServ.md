Wanna have a sweet vanity hostmask? Follow these instructions and you can.

First, you need an account with NickServ and to be logged into said account.  See instructions on that.

Next, you message HostServ with your requested vhost like this:

/msg hostserv request vhost.goes.here

An ircop will look at your vhost, check it and if it passes muster, give it to you.

Get creative! I know someone who has Twi!light@Sparkle as her hostmask.
