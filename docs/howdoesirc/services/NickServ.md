NickServ and you:

Ponychat runs Atheme services, which let you secure your name so that other people can't use it.

Register like this

/msg nickserv register password email

Login like this:

/msg nickserv identify accountname password

Your account name is the nick you used to make your account. EX:

/msg nickserv identify niichan hunter2

Using NickServ accounts, you can register channels with ChanServ, get channel operator status in other channels (if added), and other fun stuff.

Why should you care? So people don't take your nick.
