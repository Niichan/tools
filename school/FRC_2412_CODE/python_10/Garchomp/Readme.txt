Hello,

The files in here are largely self-explanitory

robot.py has the main robot loop

inputs.py handles all inputs on the robot level

outputs.py handles all outputs on the robot level

util.py has useful functions you may use, like util.fail()

debug_tests.py supposedly has a suite of testing functions,
but I haven't updated it yet

NOTE: My code prints a LOT of data to the screen, and thanks 
to my using of pygame for handling virtual inputs, you can test
most of the robot features _INCLUDING PNEUMATICS_ from any 
computer with both python and pygame installed
